    "Quantum Computer is a special type of computer where, instead of regular bits, you have Qubits which can be in more than one state at once and then, upon observation or wave collapse, be resolved into either 0 or 1. The quantum algorithms developed for such computers use the concept of superposition and other quantum properties to enhance functionalities like search, validation, and cryptography that cannot currently be achieved with a classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, due to certain quantum properties of qubits, some algorithms perform exponentially faster compared to their classical alternatives, like Grover's search algorithm and so on. Even though this field is still in its infancy, it threatens the entirety of past cryptography standards. For example, with the rise of quantum computers, cybersecurity has started to move away from RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Quantum Computing experts are now working on better “uncrackable” options, known as quantum-resistant or post-quantum cryptography, that even a much more sophisticated quantum computer cannot crack. Once we have fewer errors per qubit, more stability, and a larger number of affordable qubits, there will be countless use cases for quantum computers — from the field of pharma (trying different combinations to create the perfect chemical compound or medicine), to the field of cryptography, biology (testing millions of DNA combinations), cosmology/astronomy (identifying deep space objects), and so much more."
